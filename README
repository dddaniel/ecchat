ECCHAT *** PRE ALPHA ***


Ecchat is a chat system that uses Eliptic Curve Cryptography.

How does it work ?

Clients and Servers verify each other using a PKI.
The server only holds contact lists and accepts clients
signed by the same CA.

All communication is End to End encrypted and signed.

Scripts for creating CAs and Clients are in ./ca-scripts
